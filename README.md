# ðŸ‘‹ hello

A little command-line tool which helps reduce manual work for content creators.  

### Why?

Social media is hard. On one side, you would like to keep all platforms updated
and share your creations with the world. On the other hand, maintaining all of
them takes away a substantial amount of time from actually creating content.

You might say that this is not an important problem to solve - and I agree to
some extent. But having a side-project next to work is a tough thing to handle,
and every little step that can be automated saves some time for more important
things like... uhm... friends and family?

You might say that this is cheating - and you might be right. Submitting an
article is a soulless work of honor that should be done manually as a sign of
respect (yo) to your audience. But guess what: most of your audience doesn't
care about your link on social media, it cares about your content.

You might say there are similar tools - and that's true. There's
[Buffer](https://buffer.com), which can do everything that this tool can, but
better. Nevertheless, the goal is to build a free tool under a permissive
license that is easy to hack on.


Therefore I created **hello**.

### Installation

```
cargo install hello-rs
```

### Usage

Create a `.env` file with your credentials. See `.env_dist` for an example.

After that, run `hello -h` to get started.

For example, to submit a link to Reddit, run
```
hello reddit subredditnamehere "Give up" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs"
```

### Currently supported platforms

* [X] Twitter
* [X] HackerNews
* [X] Slack
* [ ] Patreon (tough one, as the API does not support publishing yet)
* [ ] Meetup.com
* [ ] Discourse (tough one, as only admins can get an API key)
* [ ] Bring your own!

### How to get your credentials

##### Reddit

Create an app at reddit.com/prefs/apps.
After that, add your credentials to `.env`.
Then you can run `hello` like so:

```
hello reddit yoursubredditname "I gave up" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs"
```

##### Twitter

Make an app for yourself at apps.twitter.com and add the credentials to the
`.env` file. On first execution of `hello`,
you will get an access token for your app via OAuth.

Then run the following command to send a tweet:

```
hello twitter "Hello! https://github.com/hello-rust/hello"
```

Follow the instructions on the screen to save that for all subsequent requests.

##### Slack

Create an app at https://api.slack.com/apps.
The app name doesn't matter. Choose the workspace that you want to send messages
to.

Click on "create". You will be redirected to the configuration page where you
click on "permissions".

Look for "scopes" and select one of the following:

* `chat:write:user` if you want `hello` to send messages using your Slack username.
* `chat:write:bot` if you want `hello` to send messages using the app username.

At the top, you should see your `OAuth` token, which you have to store in the
`.env` file of `hello`. If you don't see your token, you might have to click on
"request approval" to be allowed to install the app into the selected workspace.

That's all you need. Save everything. 

Run the following command to send a message to `your-channel-name`:

```
hello slack "your-channel-name" "Hello! https://github.com/hello-rust/hello"
```

#### HackerNews

Since HackerNews doesn't have an API for submitting links, we have to be
creative.
We use the awesome [fantoccini](https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini) to control
a [WebDriver](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/2757#issuecomment-304529217)
compatible browser.

1. Install geckodriver by fetching the [latest build from their release page](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
2. Add your HN credentials to `.env`.

Example:

```
hello hn "Show HN: Hello, a CLI tool for managing social media" https://github.com/hello-rust/hello
```
